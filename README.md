I'm an experienced full-stack software developer and seasoned expert on front-end technologies and application development, from ideation to launch.

## Over 25 Years Of Building Delightful Things

### Alexa Personality <span>(2021 - 2024)</span>

At Alexa Personality I worked directly with Amazon teams to create engaging interactive experiences for Echo Show devices, including external partners such as Disney and Nintendo. I created new onboarding processes and documentation to help these teams build and launch personalized Alexa applications.

* I was lead developer for a series of new asset management tools, saving content creators and developers hours each day and driving customer contacts to zero.
* I led the effort to add new personalization capabilities to Alexa Large Language Model (LLM) tools, working across global teams to deliver personalized responses through prompt engineering.

### IMDb <span>(2008 - 2021)</span>

During my tenure with IMDb I designed, built, and launched numerous features to an audience of millions of daily vistors. As a lead developer I worked with product teams to clarify requirements, create technical designs, and drive consensus across teams to effectively build and launch innovative features.

* I was lead developer on a key third-party integration project, coordinating efforts between internal and external engineering teams to deliver a revenue-generating solution that practically eliminated operational overhead.
* As a lead developer for IMDb's mobile website, I built and launched new features and managed overall site health.
* I designed, built, and launched IMDb's first mobile app deep-linking feature, significantly increasing installs of the IMDb iOS and Android apps.
* I created a cross-client rich email templating framework complete with onboarding documentation, allowing our marketing team to reach millions of IMDb customers with promotional messages.
* I designed, built, and launched IMDb's mobile-friendly message boards and IMDb's first video search interface for movie clips and trailers.

### Amazon <span>(2003 - 2008)</span>

* As one of the first developers on the nascent Amazon Advertising team, I was lead developer for the first-ever IAB ad placements on Amazon's retail pages, including Amazon's first "leaderboard" ad on Amazon's retail homepage and Amazon's first full-page advertising campaign for Lincoln vehicles.
* As part of the Amazon Associates dev team I designed and built customer workflows for creating affiliate ads and links, giving thousands of creators new ways to monetize traffic.

### KnowNow <span>(2001 - 2003)</span>

KnowNow built real-time, device-agnostic publish-and-subscribe data services using common internet technologies. During my tenure I designed and built web-based chat clients, real-time server activity monitoring apps, and Excel spreadsheet integrations.

### Cleveland.com/Advance Local <span>(1998 - 2000)</span>

At Cleveland.com I led both the UX and technical design and integration of Sun Newspapers into the Cleveland Plain Dealer, working with outside teams and bringing in thousands of new readers. I also designed and built special editorial sections for holidays, teen interests, and sports.
